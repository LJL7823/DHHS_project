              Human eyes have 3 cone cells that detect and receive light: L
              (red), M (green), and S (blue). People who have different types of
              colorblindness either don’t have certain cone cells or have cone
              cells that drift towards light received by other cone cells.

              &emsp;&emsp;Accessibility and usability for those with
              colorblindness has been a perennial issue in multiple forms of
              media. Especially in digital media, many sites are designed solely
              with those who can see the full visible color spectrum
              (common-type color vision) in mind. In 1998, Congress amended the
              1973 Rehabilitation Act (Section 508) to require that Federal
              electronic information be made accessible to all peoples with
              disabilities, including those with colorblindness. But this only
              applies to federal electronic information, and there are still a
              number of issues that crop up:
            </p>
            <p class="list-item">
              - One Redditor complained that their township required a
              color-based verification to send emails to their local government,
              which thus made such communications impossible for those with
              colorblindness.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item">
              - The presentation of data in the form of graphs & charts are
              notoriously bad for colorblindness. Often, shades of color in
              charts such as pie charts will look similar through the eyes of
              one or multiple types of colorblindness.
            </p>
            <p class="research-body">
              Along with issues at the Federal level, there are a number of
              other digital mediums that have difficulty with accessibility for
              those with colorblindness:
            </p>
            <p class="list-item">
              - Sites through which you can purchase tickets may have poor
              colorblind accessibility. When seats are color-coded, these colors
              can look incredibly similar to some people with certain
              color-blindnesses, which makes it difficult to figure out what
              color means what.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item">
              - In a number of popular video game franchises, such as Fifa and
              Battlefield, colorblind accessibility leaves much to be desired.
              Multiple elements blend into the background. In Fifa, kits of
              different teams may appear similar, making it hard to tell who is
              on which team. In Battlefield, the sheer number of multicolored
              widgets, HUD elements, and trackers make it impossible to tell
              what’s going on.
            </p>
            <p class="list-item">
              - Many graphing and data visualization softwares use colors
              mapping to help users interpret data, which can be difficult to
              read with a color vision deficiency.

          &emsp;&emsp;In today’s world, driving and the road is vital to
          society's function. A solid majority of people in the United States
          have a driver's license, which has a vision requirement to obtain.
          Many people are required to wear glasses or contact lenses to drive,
          and their restriction is listed on their license. There isn’t,
          however, a color vision requirement, although implementing one has
          been considered.
        </p>
        <p class="research-body">
          &emsp;&emsp;In a study conducted by Barry L Cole, an Australian
          optometrist, it is shown how many colorblind people acknowledge their
          risk and may have a higher accident rate. The study discusses a weak
          correlation between red-green colorbind people and the rate at which
          they get in rear-end car collisions, most likely due to a lack of
          ability to see brake lights of a car ahead. This idea is reinforced by
          data from a laboratory simulation comparing color-impaired people to
          people with normal color vision, concluding a correlation between
          color vision and a longer reaction time in determining traffic
          signals.

        <p class="research-body">
          &emsp;&emsp;George H. Williams, Professor of English at the University
          of South Carolina, writes, “Digital knowledge tools that assume
          everyone approaches information with the same abilities and using the
          same methods risk excluding a large percentage of people. In fact,
          such tools actually do the work of disabling people by preventing them
          from using digital resources altogether.” In class, we’ve talked a lot
          about digital accessibility, which is hugely important as there are so
          many different ways that a human body can function, and not all of
          those ways are always accounted for in digital media. Color Blindness
          is no different. Often, colored elements of design will only take into
          account its users that can see the full range of the visible spectrum
          of colors, thus creating a design that is difficult or impossible for
          people with color blindness to understand and use properly. Universal
          Design is a concept that attempts to foster accessibility in digital
          media, and Color Universal Design is a specific subset of Universal
          Design that attempts to foster accessibility in digital media for
          those with color blindness.
